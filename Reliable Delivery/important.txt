We would start a prelude about 20-25 minutes before the wedding as guests are coming in.  We'd arrive around 2:45.

I believe May 28th is still available.

We have a large book of music.  If you should want something that we do not have, there are two options: if we have to order music, you would need to pay for that cost, usually starting at around $30.  Our cellist, Rachael, can also write arrangements-- I'm not sure how much she charges for that.

I am going to foward this to Rachael so she can send you a packet.
Thanks so much!
